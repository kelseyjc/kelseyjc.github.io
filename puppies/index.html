            <h1>Facts and Statistics to Consider</h1>
            <p>According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)... </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Animals are admitted to shelters for a few reasons: they were strays living on the streets, they were rescued from harmful environments like puppy mills or dog fighting, or they are brought in by owners who can no longer care for them</li>
              <li>Dogs who are forced into fighting rings have their ears and tails clipped to make them more difficult for other dogs to grab</li>
              <li>Puppy mills are where dogs are forced to live in overcrowded and unsanitary circumstances, where the owners are solely focused on profit instead of the animals' well-being
              <li>3.9 million dogs are brought to shelters each year</li>
              <li>1.2 million dogs have to be euthanized every year</li>
              <li>Only 35% of shelter dogs are adopted</li>
              <li>Shelters and humane societies are the only places where potential dog owners are screened in order to ensure that the dogs will be well cared for, a requisite typically not held by pet stores
