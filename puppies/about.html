            <h1>Why I Chose This Topic</h1>
            <p> There is a reason why dogs are commonly known as man's best friend. I have loved animals my whole life and I find dogs are one of the purest forms of life who deserve to be treated as such. So when we were presented with making a website focused on something we are passionate about I had to think about what I loved most. The answer is, dogs.</p>
            <p> Out of my 20 years of life there has been probably only three years where I did not have a dog. Every pet my family has ever had as been adopted from a shelter or humane society. I have so much love and respect for these institutions because they have brought me some of the greatest moments of my life. Dog breeding is typically done for a profit, while shelters just want to provide homes for the many pets without families.</p>
            <p> For my project I wanted to collect some stories and pictures from people who have chosen to adopt dogs and hopefully convince a few others to consider adoption.</p>
